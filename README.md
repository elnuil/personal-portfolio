# Project Title: Personal Portfolio Website

# Project Description:
I developed a personal website for myself to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences to potential employers, clients, and collaborators. This website serves as a centralized platform where I can exhibit my professional profile and share my accomplishments with a wider audience. This project has been developed in 2022 and updated in 2024.


# Context:
In the future, I plan to regularly update the content of my portfolio website with new projects, experiences, and skills. I also aim to incorporate feedback from visitors to further improve the user experience and effectiveness of the website as a tool for showcasing my expertise and connecting with potential opportunities in the industry.
